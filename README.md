# Scripts for scraping and analysing tweets 

## Requirements

* python3
* quarto - https://quarto.org/

Install Python requirements with:
```pip3 install -r requirement.txt```


## Gathering data

For 1. to authenticate with the Twitter API a valid [bearer token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens) needs to be present as 
an environment variable named `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`:

```export TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=<xxxxxxx>```

1. `get_tweets.py` - downloads 5 minutes worth of data from the Twitter API V2 sample stream, and 
all tweets with the keywords "pregnant", "pregnancy" and "childbirth" in the same period and stores in `data` folder as
"alltweets.json" and "pregnancytweets.json", respectively
2. `analyse_sentiment.py` - runs `nltk` sentiment analyser on tweets gathered by 1. and stores combined data as 
 "scoredalltweets.csv" and "scoredpregnancytweets.csv". Twitter isn't very good at returning a "lang" attribute, so 
 also filter out non-English tweets here using `nlp` package.

## Analysis

WIP.
