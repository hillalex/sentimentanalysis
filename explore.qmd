## Exploring the data

To get a first idea of the distribution of sentiment scores, here are the density plots for
the control sample and the tweets about pregnancy:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("old/scoredalltweets.csv")
df_preg = pd.read_csv("old/scoredpregnancytweets.csv")
```

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2)
df[["sentiment"]].plot.density(ax = axes[0])
df_preg[["sentiment"]].plot.density(ax = axes[1]);
```

Plotting the density of sentiment scores suggests a disproportionate percentage of values are zeros, especially
in the control group. If we look at some tweets that are scored zero it is obvious that a lot of these scores are
attributable to the tweet not being in English, or being spam.

```{python}
tab = df[df.sentiment == 0].tail().text
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
Markdown(tabulate(list(map(lambda x:[x], tab))))
```

Let's try and remove non-English tweets, and tweets with links in them.

```{python}
df = df[~df.text.str.contains("https://")]
df = df[df.lang == "en"]

df_preg = df_preg[~df_preg.text.str.contains("https://")]
df_preg = df_preg[df_preg.lang == "en"]
```

If we plot the densities again, things look more reasonable now. It looks like tweets in geneal skew positive,
but also a lot of them fail to express a sentiment that is clearly positive *or* negative, while tweets about pregnancy
and childbirth are more readily identified as either positive or negative in tone, but fairly evenly split between the
two.

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2)
df[["sentiment"]].plot.density(ax = axes[0])
df_preg[["sentiment"]].plot.density(ax = axes[1]);
```

Let's check some of those zero scores tweets again:

```{python}
tab = df[df.sentiment == 0].tail().text
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
Markdown(tabulate(list(map(lambda x:[x], tab))))
```

These do seem like genuinely neutrally valenced English tweets that are not spam.

The positive skew of all tweets and symmetric distribution of the keyword tweets is even clearer if looking at the
boxplots:

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1,ncols=2)
df[["sentiment"]].boxplot(ax = axes[0])
df_preg[["sentiment"]].boxplot(ax = axes[1]);
```

Ok, so what do the most negative and positive tweets about pregnancy look like?
Here are some of the most negative tweets:

```{python}
sorted = df_preg.sort_values(by="sentiment")
worst = sorted.head(5).text
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
Markdown(tabulate(list(map(lambda x:[x.replace("\n", " ")], worst))))
```

It looks like only one of these is actually about the experience of being pregnant.
Two are about abortion, one is about fiction, and one is about Meghan Markle.

And some of the most positive:

```{python}
best = sorted.tail(5).text
from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
Markdown(tabulate(list(map(lambda x:[x.replace("\n", " ")], best))))
```

These aren't looking very relevant either, unfortunately. Three of them are about the experience of pregnancy but only
one seems to be unambiguously positive, and one appears to be some kind of transphobia.
